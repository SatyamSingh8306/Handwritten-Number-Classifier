# MNIST Deep Learning Project

This project uses Keras and TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a deep learning model.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset contains:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-deep-learning.git
   cd mnist-deep-learning
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the following command to train the model:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

## Model
The model is a Artifical Neural Network (ANN) with several convolutional and dense layers for classification.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test set.
